Difference between get() and load() :~ {

Hibernate Session provide different methods to fetch data from database.
 Two of them are - get() and load(). There are also a lot of overloaded 
 methods for these, that we can use in different circumstances. At first 
 look both get() and load() seems similar because both of them fetch the
  data from database, however there are few differences between them, 

  
  
    get() loads the data as soon as it’s called whereas load() returns a proxy object and loads data only when it’s actually required, so load() is better because it support lazy loading.
    Since load() throws exception when data is not found, we should use it only when we know data exists.
    We should use get() when we want to make sure data exists in the database.
  
  
  get() method of hibernate session returns null if object is not found
  in cache as well as in database.
  get() involves database hit if object doesn't exists in session cache 
  and returns a fully initialized object may involve several database call.
  Use get method if you are not sure that object exists in Database or not.
  
  
  load() methods throws ObjectNotFoundException if object is not found on
  cache as well as in database but never returns null.
  load() method can return proxy in place and only initialize the object 
  or hit the database if any method other than getId() is called on 
  persistent or Entity object. This lazy initialization increases the
   performance.
   Use load method if you are sure that object exists on database.

   Fetching Types {
   
   Lazy LOad : loads only those data which are requested... { Increase Performance }
   
   Eager Loading : loads all data available... { Decre4ase Performance }
   
   }
